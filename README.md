# What is this? 

This is the repository I am using to follow along with the examples 
and exercises from "Bayesian Analysis with Python (Third Edition)". 

You can find the book here: https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/bayesian-analysis-with-python-9781805127161

I am following the examples from the author's repo: https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP3/

# How to set up the environment? 

The author recommends using conda (see his repo), but I prefer using `pipenv`.

After installing `pipenv` and `pyenv` (for managing python versions), you can set up your environment by running: 
```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment using: 
```bash
pipenv shell 
```

All the dependencies are locked to the versions recommended by the author.
